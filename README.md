This is a basic implementation of the WebAudio API set up for general experimentation.

based on the tutorial here: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/

Broken down into iterations to keep different experiments separate and re-use modules where possible:
- 1) loads a number of sounds and allows the user to play them by clicking a link: load-click.html

TODO
- use JQuery for XHR Request
